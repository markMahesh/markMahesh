# Hi folks ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Pursuing Undergraduate Student in Computer Science Engineering (CSE) from IIIT 
Nagpur with passion for new technologies, and always learning to add new skills in 
my skill set.
                         I am a hardworking person but a believer in working smart. 
Always prepared to face any challenges in my life, and I see them as opportunities 
that give me a chance to learn and grow. 
                     As of now, I have spent almost 2 and half years in learning engineering
concepts and technologies related to Data Structure and Algorithms as well as in
Python. 
        I am also an active competitive coder, and fond of Problem Solving on platforms like CodeChef and CodeForces. My next
step is towards learning Data Science for Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Cloud Computing.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Open Source Machine Learning Project.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m a consistent competitive coder.
